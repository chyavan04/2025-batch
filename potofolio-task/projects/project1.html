    <h1>ViT-Driven Denoising for Improved Image Quality</h1>
    <p>Built a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based denoising model with optimized attention mechanisms, 
improving image clarity on noisy datasets. 
• Achieved +15% PSNR gain and higher SSIM compared to CNN-based methods, effectively preserving 
critical fine details and image textures.. 
• Developed end-to-end pipeline with Streamlit UI for real-time denoising in medical imaging, 
surveillance, and automation. 
• Skills: Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, Transformers, Image Processing, Streamlit, PSNR/SSIM evaluation.</P>
